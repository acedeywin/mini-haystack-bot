This functionality is absent from JavaScript, however, owing to its asynchronous nature. In this article, we’ll look briefly at why this might be, then how we can implement a sleep function ourselves.

Understanding JavaScript’s Execution Model
Before we get going, it’s important to make sure we understand JavaScript’s execution model correctly.

Consider the following Ruby code:
