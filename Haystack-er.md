Work directly with our CTO to develop software used by top engineering executives.

You'll be engineer #3. Unlike a corporate job we'll expect you to learn fast, take on new responsibilities, 
and take on challenges typically reserved for Level III engineers at the top tech companies. We expect you to
be self-guided, learn fast, throw away more code than not, focusing on the business bottlenecks delivering real impact,
trying new ideas and iterating the product on day basis - not weeks or months. We are moving fast, and expect you to be fast.

Haystack is the right place for you if you are curious, driven, and constantly learning. Learn new technologies, practices, 
and challenges as we continue to grow, scale, and lead the industry in elite engineering. There are few opportunities to help 
grow and scale a product from the ground up and lead the industry with regards to elite engineering practices.
